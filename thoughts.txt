// In Board:

BlockObserver* getCurrentBlock(int row, int col){
    // Should return a pointer to a BlockObserver such that row and col are within its range.
}

void render(){
    // This function will only call GraphicDisplay and TextDisplay's notify function
}

// In Subject/Board:
void renderObservers(){
    // This will call the notify functions on ONLY the displayObservers.
}

// In GraphicDisplay and TextDisplay:
Logic: We will call subject's getCurrentBlock on every indices, take the pointer and print 
void notify()

// Overall:
Whenever a new block is created, the block will be manipulated first in the player. 
    When the block drops or reaches the bottom/another block (tested by seeing if there are any blocks below)
    we can check clearRow on each row from the bottom row.
When a block moves left or right, player's "makeMoveLeft" or "makeMoveRight" will call moveLeft or moveRight
    on the block that was just created. moveLeft/moveRight will first check for the boundaries to the left
    and right of the block to see if a move is possible at all (Same with turning). If a move is not possible,
    the function call will have no action. 
We also need a char field in Block that is initiliazed to the specific block type letter; this is used for
    printing in GraphicDisplay and TextDisplay.
BlockObserver's notify function should DO NOTHING since it is outputting in GraphicDisplay and TextDisplay.
Write BlockObserver first.
